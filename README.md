# Infection game

## Introduction

This game is a two player board game. Players play in turns. The player with the highest amount of pawns in the end of the game wins it.

## Game rules

The rules are very simple:
- Players play in turns ;
- When a player has to play he has two choices :
  - Move a pawn to two cells in a given direction ;
  - Duplicate one of its pawns to an its adjacent cell. Then all adjacent ennemy pawns are contaminated (which means they now belong to the player that just played).
- If the active player has no pawns left at the start of his round, the game is over;
- If the active player cannot make a move the game is over.
